# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

ðŸ“‚ _Specializations > Web Stack programming > Back-end_

Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means that variable types are dynamically set at run-time, upon assignment of a value to a variable.

For example, in

```python
def fn(a, b):
return a + b
```

The types of **a** and **b** are not known at build-time, only when **a** and **b** are assigned values at run-time.

Hence, calling

```python
fn("a", 1)
```

somewhere in your code will not raise an exception until the code is actually executed and the function is called:

```python
>>> fn("a", 1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

In Python 3, type annotations do not change this. Python is still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

- **Code documentation:** thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) willknow exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and acceleratethe development cycle.
- **Linting and validation:** code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured toautomatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with **mypy**
